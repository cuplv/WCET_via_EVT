### The worst case execution times via extreme value theory

To run the extreme value distributions over SnapBuddy example:
```
Rscript extreme_analysis.R Dataset/Snapbuddy_timing.txt 15.6
```
You can use any other dataset of experiments and the threshold can be found in the paper for each experiment.
